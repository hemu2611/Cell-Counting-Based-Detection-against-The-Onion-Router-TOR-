# Cell-Counting-Based-Detection-against-The-Onion-Router-TOR-
This project was built on a low latency communication system using TOR where the size of the IP packets is dynamic and the IP layer may repack cells.  This technique allowed efficient tracking of anonymous communication among users by embedding a secret signal into the variation of the cell counter at the target traffic.
